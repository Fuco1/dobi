# Example - Tag docker images with version and timestamp

Docker images often have multiple tags that can point at a single image. Got
example `golang:1.6` and `golang:1.6.3` and `golang:latest` could all be the
same image.

This example demonstrates how to add tags to images from data generated by
``dobi``. An environment variable is used to pass in the application version.

To build and tag the images run:

    APP_VERSION=v1.2.1 dobi tag-images

To view all the tags run

    docker images | grep example/tagged

To remove all the images run:

    APP_VERSION=v1.2.1 dobi clean
