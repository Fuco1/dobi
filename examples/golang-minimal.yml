#
# An example configuration for a golang application.
#
# This configuration handles the common tasks required for most projects:
#   * build one or more binaries
#   * run unit tests
#   * run integration tests against a service dependency (todo)
#   * run linting and style checks
#   * build a docker image for publishing the application
#

#
# An `image` resource
#
# Produces an image with a single tag
