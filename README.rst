Docker Build Pipeline
=====================

An opinionated docker build tool for docker build pipelines.


DBP Features 
------------

(Planned features)

* Use a builder container to create the context or artifact for an image
* Build multiple images that depend on each other with unique ids so that 
  multiple builds on the same host don't conflict with each other
* Tag and push images to a registry
* Skip rebuild if the context hasn't changed since the last build


Variables
----------

To keep pipelines from interfering with each other a unique tag is used for
every image and container. By default a random id is used, but you can also
specify a unique tag from an environment variable.

The value supports many variables:

  * ENV.USER - the $USER environment variable
  * ENV.UID - the $UID environment variable
  * ENV.<environment variable> - a value of an environment variable
  * GIT.SHA - the git sha (with -dirty if there are un-committed changes)
  * GIT.BRANCH - the git branch name
  * GIT.USERNAME - the git username from git config at user.name
  * UNIQUE_ID - a random id generated by dbp
