Docker Build Pipeline
=====================

An un-opinionated docker build tool for complex build pipelines.


DBP Features 
------------

(Planned features)

* Render Dockerfiles as Jinja2 templates before building the image
* Use a builder container to create the context or artifact for an image
* Build multiple images that depend on each other with unique ids so that 
  multiple builds on the same host don't conflict with each other
* When the pipeline completes successfully tag and push images to a registry


Unique Tag
----------

To keep pipelines from interfering with each other a unique tag is used for
every image and container. By default a random is used, but you can also
specify a unique tag in the configuration using `unique_tag` key. 

The value supports many variables:

  * ENV.USER - the username
  * ENV.UID - the user id
  * ENV.<environment variable> - a value of an environment variable
  * GIT.SHA - the git sha
  * GIT.BRANCH - the git branch name
  * GIT.USERNAME - the git username from git config at user.name
  * UNIQUE - a random id generated by dbp
