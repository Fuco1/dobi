Variables
=========

.. note::

    This feature has not been implemented yet. This document is just a plan and
    may not reflect the actual implementation.

The ``dobi.yaml`` file may use variables provided by ``dobi`` to alter the
behaviour of a task when it's run.

Available variables:

* ``ENV.USER`` - the $USER environment variable
* ``ENV.UID`` - the $UID environment variable
* ``ENV.<environment variable>`` - a value of an environment variable
* ``GIT.SHA`` - the git sha (with -dirty if there are un-committed changes)
* ``GIT.BRANCH`` - the git branch name
* ``GIT.USERNAME`` - the git username from git config at user.name
* ``UNIQUE_ID`` - a random id generated by dobi
